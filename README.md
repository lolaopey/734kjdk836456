This project is intended for viewing by a specific individual and the time required for completion was 3 hours. 
There are many things that I would have done differently with more time, for example, passing the api endpoint from the 
interface.php file and looping through the indivdual currency files SMART.php and BITCOIN.php. I may have used 
autoloading if the program was vast. 
There are many other things that I have ommitted such as testing, security and error handling. 
I also included another feature to compensate for the fact that smartcash is undefined, unless you change the the url on line 77 of interface.php to SMART.php. The data for Smartcash was unclear in any case.

To use the script you simply render display interface.php in the browser enter the amount in GBP or click get rates.

Please remember I have do not have any commercial experience, so need a bit longer to plan and organise my code!
